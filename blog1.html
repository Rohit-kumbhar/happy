                           This is true that the women in our society are misbehaved, treated badly and even they are treated as an object and the crimes against women have increased rapidly and one can find many reasons for that.
                        </p>
        
                        <p>
                          But I personally believe that there are two main reasons why women are treated in such a manner and why crimes against women are rising rapidly day by day. The reasons are:
                        </p>

                           <ol>
 <li> <b>The objectification of women</b> </li>
<li> <b> The Indian traditional family model </b> </li>

</ol>

                        <h3> The objectification of women:</h3>
                        <h2>  a.    What is the objectification of women?</h2>
                        <p>
                          Women objectification is the act of treating women like an object and not as an individual human being.

                      <h2>b.   How are women objectified?</h2>
                      <p>
                          Women’s body is being continuously used to promote a certain product through advertisements on TV ads, posters etc. for example the ads of men perfume where often a woman is illogically featured. Nowadays most of the music albums are also featuring women for the same reason example Love by Kendrick Lamar, Swalla by Jason Derulo etc.
                      </p>
                      <img src="http://media2.onsugar.com/files/2013/07/30/003/n/1922398/c6833f517aa9bee4_thumb_temp35398911375225309/i/Robin-Thicke-Defends-Blurred-Lines-Music-Video-Video.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                      <p>Also in Indian cinema, a song like Chikni Chameli is playing the same role. Fashion Industry is also partially doing the same thing. 
                      </p>
                      <h2>c.    Why women are objectified?</h2>
                      <p>It is a business strategy, more specifically a marketing strategy they only want to promote their products thus they (the marketing team) use the women body to get people’s attention on it and thus on their product, this is called ‘cross promotion’, they get your attention to something then they relate it with something else and kind of creates an artificial need, for example in an ad of perfume they will firstly show you the ideal women and will advise you to use such perfume for some illogical purpose. This has a horrible impact on the young man and woman.</p>
                      <img src="http://iambored.pro/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Untitled1.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                      <h2> d.   How does it influence people?</h2>
                      <p>It directly influences peoples thought and mindset, both men and women are influenced dangerously and differently by it.
          After the continuous effort of those ads, the mindset of most men are actually influenced, they start thinking and treating women differently like an object and every next woman they see looks different to them.
          Women are also influenced by the continuous exploration of these ads, they actually start thinking that the perfect and ideal women should look like them(as featured in the ad), they should wear such dress, behave in a certain manner etc.
          And this is how people are influenced.</p>
          <h2> e.    How objectification is destroying the society?</h2>
          <p>The advertisements which will reach lakhs of people across the world will definitely influence the people and society. I believe that such advertisements has a serious impact on young people. And thus if the men starts treating women like an object and not like an individual human-being also if women starts treating there selves in the same manner and starts doing things which makes them fit in the society of new mindset created by them, how can you expect men to behave properly with that humanly object and thus violence against women are taking place which is also creating an inequality on the bases of gender and this is destroying the society.</p>
          <img src="https://www.themodernman.com/wp-content/uploads/the-life-of-a-beautiful-woman-01.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid"
          <br>
          <p>Thus it can be concluded that women are objectified through the advertisement which is influencing the people’s mindset in our society and thus with this influenced mindset we change our behavior toward opposite gender and thus it is one of the main reason why women are treated badly in our society.</p>
                      
                        <h3>The Indian traditional family model </h3>
                        <p>
                           Our tradition (Indian) is quite strange and it does not follow gender equality and thus I believe that this is also a reason why women are tread badly. </p>
                           <h2>  a.    What is the Indian traditional family model? </h2>
          <p> In most of the houses in our country women(mothers) are the one who takes care of everything like making food, washing cloths, managing house and what not. Also she stays whole day in home and manages almost everything and young girls in the house also gets the same training since here childhood to sever for her future family, whereas men are the one who goes out every day and works to earn money and thus to feed his family and young boys since their childhood are encouraged to become like her father and the old members of the family takes care if the family is fallowing this model or not. </p>
          <img src="https://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/MOMS_HOUSEWORK_POST.jpeg" alt="" class="img-fluid"
          <br>
          <p>Above is the general model of a family in our country and this traditional model of family is followed from generation to generation but this family model has a problem and thus I believe  this is also a reason why women are treated badly in India.</p>
           <h2>   b.   What is the problem with this model?</h2>
          <p>The child in the family since his/her childhood she the difference between her mother and father and he recognizes the difference between them as the difference between men and women. He/she may conclude that women are made to serve the male and to do all the house-works like cooking, washing etc. (as he sees her mother to do) and men are the one who are the head and master of women and women are dependent on men.</p>
          <p>Since the boy-child and girl-child follow their father and mother respective therefore their mindset is been created in this manner.</p>
          <p>And thus a new generation of the same type where men is superior to women is created. </p>
          <br><br>
          <p> We can conclude that this family model has become outdated our society need to adopt the model where gender-equality (which is the fundamental rights) is maintained.
